//QUESTION#4) A car travelled back and forth from point A to point B. With a distance being (single trip) 1207KM. During
//the forward trip fuel price was 118/liter while returning it was 123/liter. Calculate the total fuel cost
//(both ways) and the fuel consumed (total trip). Use the carâ€™s fuel average as input from the user (Input
//must be positive make some restrictions on only accepting positive input)
